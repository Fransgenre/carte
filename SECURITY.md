## Reporting a Vulnerability

Thank you for improving the security of our project. We take all security vulnerabilities seriously.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Security Advisories](https://github.com/SafeHavenMaps/safehaven/security/advisories) section of our GitHub repository.
2. Click on the "Report a vulnerability" button.
3. Follow the instructions to provide details about the vulnerability.

This feature ensures that your report is kept confidential and allows us to work on a fix before the vulnerability is disclosed publicly.

We appreciate your effort to make our project more secure.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates only for the latest release. There is no backporting of security fixes to older versions.
